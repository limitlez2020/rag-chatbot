# RAG AI Agent

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI Agent designed to assist students in learning about their professors based on data from Rate My Professor website. The AI Agent is equipped with an intuitive interface that allows users to ask questions and receive responses generated from the data it was trained on.

## Project Overview

The RAG AI Agent was developed to provide students with insights and information about their professors by utilizing data from Rate My Professor. The agent can answer specific questions about professors, offering valuable insights based on student reviews and opinions. Currently, the agent operates on hardcoded data, with plans for future enhancements to allow real-time data fetching and training.

## Features

- **Professor Information Retrieval**:
  - Users can ask the AI Agent questions about professors, and it will provide answers based on the reviews and opinions it was trained on.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**:
  - The AI Agent uses RAG techniques to generate accurate and relevant responses by retrieving the most pertinent data before generating the answer.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - The web app features a clean and intuitive UI, making it easy for students to interact with the AI Agent and get the information they need.
